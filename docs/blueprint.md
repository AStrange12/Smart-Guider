- Background color: Very light grey (#F5F5F5), nearly white, providing a clean and professional backdrop that makes data visualizations and content stand out. The background does not distract from the dashboard cards or controls.

- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif for a modern, machined look, to ensure readability and clarity in both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist, clear icons to represent financial categories and actions, ensuring ease of understanding.
- Design a card-based layout for the dashboard, presenting key information in easily digestible chunks.
- Incorporate subtle animations for transitions and data updates to provide a dynamic and engaging user experience.
